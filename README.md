# Guesser Game Using Java

A simple Java-based number guessing game that demonstrates core programming concepts such as object-oriented programming, control flow, input handling, and logic building.

## Features

- Interactive command-line interface
- Random number generation
- Player-based guessing logic
- Winner evaluation system
- Clean, modular OOP structure

## Game Description

The Guesser Game consists of three roles:
1. **Guesser** – Picks a number.
2. **Players (Player1, Player2, Player3)** – Try to guess the number chosen by the Guesser.
3. **Umpire** – Compares the guesses and determines the winner(s).

## How It Works

1. The Guesser selects a number (internally or via input).
2. Each Player attempts to guess the number.
3. The Umpire gathers guesses and announces the winner(s) based on accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- Java (Core)
- JDK 8 or higher
- Command-line interface (CLI)
